## Features
This mod gives each party member a unique colour around their party panel icon in battles and dungeons. It is fully configurable with whatever colors you wish to use, even allowing a special RGB™ Gamer™ Mode™ which cycles through all colors!

The mod also attempts to apply minor fixes to the vanilla party panel, such as smoothing out really rough edges and cropping artifacts, and restoring design-accurate hair and clothing colors which for some reason are either missing or washed out in the vanilla game.

## Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with any other Party Panel mods as long as you have them below this one in your mod list.

If you notice that another Party Panel mod still has the normal orange outline for everyone when exploring dungeons then it will need to be updated to remove this from its sprites (the ones in camp/party/party.bin). This is necessary as for some reason, these sprites include the outline twice, once in the actual texture, and then again using vertex colouring (what allows for the colour to be changed dynamically).

## Configuration
The configuration is split into a foreground and background colour for each party member. Note that you can edit this and see changes in real time as long as you click Save after making changes.

However, as Reloaded does not currently have a way to nicely display colour options in mod configurations it's a bit of a mess. I'd like to look into this at some point (no time soon) but for now you'll just have to deal with the options being kind of randomly laid out, sorry.
